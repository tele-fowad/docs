## Introduction

Welcome to Telepie’s API Documentation. We’ve designed this document to help developers and Telepie users fully understand and integrate our API for a seamless and easy deployment. These APIs enable you to utilize most of your Telepie panel's features fully.

We have listed all the APIs, their required parameters, and their example requests and responses on the right for easy understanding.

Our APIs are based around REST architecture and use the basic [HTTP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes) request methods. Our APIs accept [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) - encoded body requests and return data in the same form.

### Document and API Usage Guidelines

- Our APIs use the basic HTTP request codes: POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE.
- You can select the required response and request code language by selecting it from the drop-down menu on the top.
- Note: Any requests made using the valid API credentials will affect the real-time data in your Telepie account.
  Authorization: Bearer
- All the APIs are provided with their appropriate example requests and responses for successful and failed calls.

### Support

- All the required information on integration is in this document. Please read it thoroughly.
- For any integration and API-related support, you can feel free to drop us an email at support@telepie.com.
